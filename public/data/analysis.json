    "The Time To First Byte (TTFB) is consistently low across all pages, indicating that the server response time is adequate.",
    "First Contentful Paint (FCP) is relatively high on the homepage (634.8 ms) compared to the pricing page (155 ms) and blog page (224 ms). This suggests that the homepage might have more complex or unoptimized content above the fold.",
    "The blog page has a longer duration (1078 ms) than the pricing page (896 ms), but its load time is still lower. This could be due to the blog page having more resources that are efficiently loaded, or the pricing page having resources that are not optimized.",
    "To improve overall web performance, it is essential to focus on optimizing the \"How It Works\" page and addressing the homepage's higher load time."
