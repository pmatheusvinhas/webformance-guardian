    "The blog page has the shortest load time, TTFB, and FCP, indicating that it is the most optimized page. Use it as a benchmark for optimizing the other pages.",
    "The pricing page has a longer FCP than the blog page, suggesting that there might be some render-blocking resources that need to be optimized.",
    "Although the TTFB is low for all pages, there is still room for improvement in reducing load time. Consider optimizing server-side rendering, reducing database queries, and implementing a content delivery network (CDN) to improve TTFB."
