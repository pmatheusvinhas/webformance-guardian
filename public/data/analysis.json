    "The blog page has the best performance among all pages, with the lowest load time, TTFB, and FCP. This could be due to optimized above-the-fold content and efficient server-side rendering.",

    "The pricing page has a longer TTFB than the homepage, despite having a similar load time. This could be due to more complex server-side processing or database queries for the pricing page."
