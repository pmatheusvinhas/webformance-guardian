    "The pricing page and blog page have the best performance, with low load times, TTFB, and FCP. These pages can serve as a benchmark for optimizing other pages.",
    "The blog page has the lowest TTFB (32.9 ms) and FCP (151.8 ms), indicating that its resources are well-optimized and load quickly.",
    "The homepage has a longer load time (536.8 ms) compared to the pricing page and blog page, suggesting that there is room for optimization. Investigating and addressing the high TTFB and FCP could significantly improve the homepage's performance."
