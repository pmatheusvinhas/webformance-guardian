To address this, it is recommended to identify and optimize the heavy resources or scripts that are causing the delay in loading.",

    "The homepage, pricing page, and blog page have good load times, with the homepage being the fastest at 564ms. This suggests that the optimization strategies applied to these pages are effective and can serve as a benchmark for optimizing the \"How It Works\" page.",
    "The TTFB (Time to First Byte) for the pricing page is relatively high (149.9ms) compared to the other pages. Although it is not a critical issue, it is worth investigating if there are any server-side configurations that can be improved to reduce this time.",
    "The load time for the blog page is slightly higher than the homepage and pricing page, despite having a lower TTFB. This might be due to larger images or other heavy resources on the blog page. An audit of these elements can help in optimizing the blog page further."
