    "TTFB is consistently low across all pages, indicating that the server response time is good. This is a positive sign for user experience.",
    "FCP is generally high, especially on the homepage. This means that the initial rendering of the page takes some time. To improve this, consider optimizing critical render-blocking resources and using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster content delivery."
