    "The \"How It Works\" page failed the test, suggesting that there might be issues with the page's resources, such as large images, unoptimized scripts, or unnecessarily complex HTML structures. Investigating these factors and implementing optimization techniques can help improve the page's performance.",
    "While the TTFB and FCP metrics are satisfactory, focusing on reducing the overall load time for the homepage and pricing page can significantly improve user experience, as faster loading pages tend to have lower bounce rates and higher user engagement.",
    "Monitoring performance trends and conducting regular web performance tests can help maintain and improve the website's overall speed and user experience."
