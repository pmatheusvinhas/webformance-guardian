    "The pricing page and blog page have the lowest load times, suggesting that their optimizations can serve as a benchmark for other pages.",
    "The Time to First Byte (TTFB) for all pages is relatively low, indicating that the server response time is adequate.",
    "The First Contentful Paint (FCP) for the homepage is slightly higher than the other pages, suggesting that the initial rendering of content could be improved. Focus on optimizing critical above-the-fold content to reduce FCP."
