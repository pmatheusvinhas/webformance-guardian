    "Key insight 1: The homepage has the longest load time (678.5ms) among the passed pages. Although it passed the test, there is room for improvement. Consider optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and leveraging browser caching to enhance homepage performance.",
    "Key insight 2: The blog page has the best TTFB (182.1ms) and FCP (304.4ms) among all pages. Analyze the blog page's configuration and apply similar optimizations to other pages to improve their performance.",
    "Key insight 3: The duration of all pages is within an acceptable range (less than 1.5 seconds). However, maintaining a high level of performance is crucial for user experience and search engine rankings. Regularly monitor and optimize web performance to ensure a smooth user experience."
