    "The Time to First Byte (TTFB) is relatively fast for all pages, indicating that the server response time is adequate.",
    "First Contentful Paint (FCP) is generally consistent across pages, suggesting that the pages are rendering their initial content quickly.",
    "The blog page has the fastest load time (277.5 ms) and FCP (173.5 ms), demonstrating effective optimization techniques. Analyzing its structure and applying similar optimizations to other pages could further improve overall performance."
