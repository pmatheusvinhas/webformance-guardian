    "The homepage, pricing page, and blog page have load times below 1 second, TTFB below 300ms, and First Contentful Paint (FCP) below 1.5 seconds, indicating good performance.",
    "The \"How It Works\" page has a significantly shorter duration than the other pages, suggesting that there might be missing resources or scripts that are causing the test to fail. Investigating and addressing these issues will help improve the page's performance.",
    "While the blog page's TTFB is higher than the other pages, it still falls within an acceptable range. However, optimizing server-side processing or caching can further improve the user experience by reducing the time it takes for the page to start loading."
