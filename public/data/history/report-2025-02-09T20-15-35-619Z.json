      "The blog page has a higher TTFB (122.8 ms) than the pricing page but still within an acceptable range. This could be due to additional database queries or server-side processing for dynamic content.",
      "The homepage has a higher FCP (527.9 ms) than the pricing and blog pages, indicating that initial content rendering could be improved. However, the overall load time is still reasonable."
