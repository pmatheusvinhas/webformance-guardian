      "The pricing page and blog page have faster load times than the homepage, suggesting that they might have been optimized more efficiently.",
      "The Time To First Byte (TTFB) is relatively low for all pages, indicating that the server response time is adequate.",
      "The First Contentful Paint (FCP) is also reasonable for all pages, meaning that the initial rendering of the page's content occurs quickly.",
      "To improve the \"How It Works\" page's performance, consider optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and reducing the number of HTTP requests. Additionally, check for any heavy scripts or plugins that might be causing the delay."
