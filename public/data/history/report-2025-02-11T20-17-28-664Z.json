      "Time to First Byte (TTFB) is relatively low across all pages, suggesting that the server response time is adequate. However, there is still room for improvement, especially on the \"How It Works\" page.",
      "First Contentful Paint (FCP) is a good indicator of user-perceived loading speed. All pages have FCP values below 600 ms, indicating that users see content quickly after navigating to the pages. Continue focusing on optimizing FCP to enhance user experience."
