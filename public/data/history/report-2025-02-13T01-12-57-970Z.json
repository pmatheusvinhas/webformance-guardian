    "insights": [
      "The pricing page has the fastest load time (266.3ms) and TTFB (41.3ms), indicating efficient rendering and server response. Analyze the page's structure and replicate its optimization techniques on other pages.",
      "The blog page has a longer FCP (327.1ms) than the pricing page, suggesting that the blog's above-the-fold content takes longer to render. Optimize images and above-the-fold content for faster FCP.",
      "Overall, the web performance test results indicate that optimization efforts should focus on the \"How It Works\" page and reducing the TTFB for the homepage."
