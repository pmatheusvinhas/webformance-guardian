      "Overall, the web performance test results are satisfactory, with most pages loading within acceptable timeframes. However, focusing on optimizing the \"How It Works\" page and further reducing TTFB and FCP for all pages can improve user experience and search engine rankings.",
      "Regularly monitoring and optimizing web performance is essential to maintain a high-quality user experience and search engine visibility. Implementing a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with automated performance testing can help maintain optimal performance levels.",
      "Analyzing individual resources and requests on each page can help identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Tools like Google Lighthouse or WebPageTest.org can provide detailed insights into specific performance issues and recommendations for improvement."
