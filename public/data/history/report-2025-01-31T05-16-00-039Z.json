      "First Contentful Paint (FCP) is generally consistent across pages, but there is a noticeable difference between the homepage (481.19999999998254 ms) and the other pages (blog page: 327.69999999998254 ms; pricing page: 419 ms). Focus on optimizing FCP for the homepage to provide a better user experience."
